# Ralph Loop — Build Mode

You are running inside a Ralph Wiggum autonomous loop (Context A).

Read `.specify/memory/constitution.md` — it contains all project principles, workflow
instructions, work sources, and completion signal requirements.

Find the highest-priority incomplete work item, implement it completely, verify all
acceptance criteria, commit and push, then output `<promise>DONE</promise>`.
