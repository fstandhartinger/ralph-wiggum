# Ralph Loop — Planning Mode

You are running inside a Ralph Wiggum autonomous loop in planning mode.

Read `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for project principles.

Study `specs/` and compare against the current codebase (gap analysis).
Create or update `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` with a prioritized task breakdown.
Do NOT implement anything.

When the plan is complete, output `<promise>DONE</promise>`.
